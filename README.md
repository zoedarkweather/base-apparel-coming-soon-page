  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned
I was using this exercise as an opportunity to practice both customizing form controls and accessibility. I added aria labels to the form elements and an aria alert to the error message and tested it with a screenreader. I think the accessibility of this design could definitely be improved - the body text and input colors are too low contrast and might not be great for someone with low vision or colorblindness.

### Continued development
Keep practicing CSS, especially layouts and working with images. I had a lot of difficulty with the images this time. The desktop image was too big for screensizes less than 1440, and the mobile image was too small for anything much bigger than 375. I tried to make the best of it, but I'm wondering if there was a better way to handle it than setting max-widths.

### Useful resources
